# SC predictions client

Initially I built this in React, but decided to try SolidJS. At the time of writing I do rather like the API, but have had a heck of the time with the tooling around testing. Putting a pause in this re-write for now. Tried both jest & vitest with solid-testing-library, but seem to be having module build type issues. Mix of ESM & CJS.
